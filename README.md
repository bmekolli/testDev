As we are usual users of Epoka’s library we have noticed a big problem in our official library aim of finding how necessary it is for Epoka University to have a 
contemporary digital library also being the aim of our project.
The first idea on this project was when we, as Epoka University students’ found out that going to the physical library to find any material we needed was a bit 
difficult because, we didn’t know if the materials we needed were there, we had difficulties finding these materials and no booking option was available so if there is 
only one book and two students need it for specific purposes they had to solve it between themselves. Spending a lot of time in the library as students, we find it very 
necessary for a digital mean to get access to the library not only for finding books and materials but also for booking seats as time to time it gets over crowded, 
especially during exam seasons.This is a slight background for the reasons we chose to conduct this study.
